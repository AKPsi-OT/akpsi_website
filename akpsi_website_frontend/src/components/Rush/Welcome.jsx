				<p>Dear Prospective Rush,</p>

				<p>
					On behalf of the Omega Theta chapter, I would like to
					welcome you to our official website where you can learn all
					about who we are and what our rush process is like. Our site
					gives you a glimpse into who we are as a chapter and the
					values that we hold: Brotherhood, Professionalism, and
					Service.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alpha Kappa Psi is one of the oldest and largest business
					fraternities in the country, with over 200 chapters
					worldwide. Our individual chapter, Omega Theta, is one of
					the largest professional fraternities on the University of
					Maryland’s campus. Even so, our chapter is dedicated to
					every individual member’s professional and personal growth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our diversity allows us to stand out from other business
					fraternities on campus. Omega Theta is comprised of members
					from over 20 different majors, from over 7 different
					countries. Our worldwide professional network explores all
					fields of business and more. We work together to provide the
					right tools and resources that will take you beyond what you
					thought possible.
				</p>

				<p>
					This Fall 2023, our rush theme is 'Swing Into Business'! I
					highly encourage you to take a chance, have confidence, and
					come out to our rush events this semester. The Brothers of
					Alpha Kappa Psi cannot wait to meet you!
				</p>
