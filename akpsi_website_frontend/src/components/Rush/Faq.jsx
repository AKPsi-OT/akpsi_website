					<h2>What is Alpha Kappa Psi?</h2>
					<p>
						We are a premier co-ed professional business fraternity
						that focuses on five pillars of success: brotherhood,
						knowledge, integrity, service, and unity. AKPsi is the
						oldest and largest professional business fraternity to
						date. Originally founded by four men at New York
						University, the professional organization now has over
						240,000 initiated members at 265 universities in 3
						countries. The Omega Theta Chapter is a group of
						like-minded individuals who have many differing goals
						and aspirations but want to combine their passions to
						make a mark in the world. Check out the national
						website.

					<h2>
						Do I have to be a student at the Smith School to rush?
					</h2>
					<p>
						No, we accept (and encourage) all majors to rush. Part
						of what makes the culture of AKPsi so notable is the
						diversity of majors, personalities, and interests of its
						members. While we focus on the importance of a business
						minded individual, no experience or major requirement is
						necessary.

						A bid is an invitation to continue on to the pledging
						process.

					<h2>What is Pledging?</h2>
					<p>
						The Pledge Process is a time for those who have received
						a bid to prepare themselves to join our fraternity. This
						includes developing yourself professionally and
						personally, learning about the fraternity, and growing
						closer with the brotherhood and your pledge class. You
						will be involved in planning and participating in
						social, professional, and service events.

				<div className="faq-qa">
					<h2>Do we haze?</h2>
					<p>
						We have a strict no hazing policy that the whole
						brotherhood follows very closely.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="faq-qa">
					<h2>I didn’t receive a bid, can I rush again?</h2>
					<p>
						Please do! We encourage you to rush again if you feel
						that AKPsi Omega Theta chapter is a good fit for
						yourself. It shows dedication and commitment which can
						potentially provide a better to chance to receiving a
						bid.
					</p>

				<div className="faq-qa">
					<h2>
						Can I be a member of another organization and still
						join?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Of course! We look for individuals who are active on
						campus. Although you can’t join more than one
						Professional Greek organization, University of Maryland
						policy allows you to be a part of both a social and a
						professional Greek organization simultaneously. However,
						be advised that with joining comes a certain time
						commitment, and we encourage you to plan your activities
						accordingly.
